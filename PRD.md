## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the Energy Theft Detection System. The system aims to leverage machine learning to identify and flag potential instances of energy theft, helping utility providers reduce losses and improve operational efficiency.

## 2. Goals

*   **Primary Goal:** Accurately detect and predict instances of energy theft.
*   Reduce non-technical losses for energy providers.
*   Provide actionable insights for investigation teams.
*   Develop a scalable and maintainable system.

## 3. Target Users

*   **Utility Companies:** Operations and revenue protection departments.
*   **Fraud Investigators:** Teams responsible for investigating theft cases.
*   **Data Analysts:** Personnel analyzing energy consumption patterns and model performance.

## 4. Current Status

The project has a foundational framework in place:

*   **Machine Learning Pipeline:** Scripts for training (`src/train.py`) a model on historical data and making predictions (`src/predict.py`) on new data are developed.
*   **Data Management:**
    *   Training Data: `data/Training.csv`
    *   Test Data: `data/Test.csv`
    *   Transformer Data: `data/Transformer.csv` (for training), `data/TransformerTest.csv` (for testing)
*   **Configuration:** Customer type configurations are managed in `config/customer_types.json`.
*   **Output:** Predictions are stored in `results/predictions.csv`.
*   **Documentation:** A problem statement is available in `docs/Problem Statement v2.docx`.
*   **Environment:** The project uses Python and dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## 5. Future Prospects & Proposed Features

### 5.1. Enhanced Model Performance & Accuracy
*   **Feature Engineering:** Explore and incorporate more sophisticated features from existing data.
*   **Algorithm Exploration:** Experiment with advanced machine learning algorithms (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Deep Learning models like LSTMs for time-series data).
*   **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Implement automated hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.
*   **Anomaly Detection Refinement:** Improve techniques to identify unusual consumption patterns more accurately.

### 5.2. Real-time/Near Real-time Detection
*   **Streaming Data Ingestion:** Develop capabilities to process data from smart meters or other sources in near real-time.
*   **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement a system for continuous model scoring and alert generation.

### 5.3. Scalability and Deployment
*   **Cloud Deployment:** Package the application for deployment on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
*   **API Development:** Create APIs for programmatic access to prediction services and model management.
*   **Containerization:** Utilize Docker/Kubernetes for easier deployment and scaling.

### 5.4. User Interface & Visualization Dashboard
*   **Dashboard:** Develop a web-based dashboard for:
    *   Visualizing key metrics (e.g., detected theft incidents, accuracy, false positive rates).
    *   Displaying details of flagged cases.
    *   Managing and tracking investigations.
*   **Reporting Tools:** Allow users to generate custom reports.

### 5.5. Alerting & Case Management System
*   **Automated Alerts:** Implement an automated system to notify relevant personnel upon detection of high-probability theft.
*   **Case Management Integration:** Allow for integration with existing case management tools or develop a lightweight internal system.

### 5.6. Advanced Analytics & Explainability
*   **Explainable AI (XAI):** Integrate techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to provide explanations for model predictions, aiding investigator understanding.
*   **Pattern Analysis:** Tools to identify common patterns or typologies of energy theft.

### 5.7. Data Enrichment
*   **External Data Sources:** Explore incorporating external data like weather patterns, socio-economic data, or public event information to improve detection accuracy.
*   **GIS Integration:** Link consumption data with geographical information for spatial analysis of theft patterns.

## 6. Success Metrics

*   **Detection Rate:** Percentage of actual theft cases correctly identified.
*   **False Positive Rate:** Percentage of legitimate consumptions incorrectly flagged as theft.
*   **Reduction in Non-Technical Losses:** Measurable decrease in financial losses attributed to energy theft.
*   **Model Accuracy/Precision/Recall/F1-Score:** Standard machine learning performance metrics.
*   **System Uptime & Reliability:** Availability of the detection system.
*   **User Adoption & Satisfaction:** Feedback from utility companies and investigators.

## 7. Assumptions

*   Sufficient historical data with labeled theft instances is available for robust model training.
*   Data quality is adequate for analysis.
*   Utility companies are willing to integrate and act upon the system's outputs.

## 8. Risks and Mitigation

*   **Data Scarcity/Quality:**
    *   **Risk:** Insufficient or poor-quality data leading to suboptimal model performance.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust data validation and cleaning processes. Explore data augmentation techniques or synthetic data generation (`src/datagen.py` could be enhanced for this).
*   **Model Drift:**
    *   **Risk:** Model performance degrades over time as consumption patterns change.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement a continuous monitoring and retraining strategy for the model.
*   **High False Positive Rate:**
    *   **Risk:** Too many false alarms leading to wasted investigator resources and loss of trust in the system.
    *   **Mitigation:** Fine-tune model thresholds, improve feature engineering, and incorporate user feedback loops.
*   **Integration Challenges:**
    *   **Risk:** Difficulty integrating with existing utility IT systems.
    *   **Mitigation:** Design flexible APIs and work closely with utility IT teams.
*   **Regulatory and Privacy Concerns:**
    *   **Risk:** Handling sensitive customer data may pose privacy risks.
    *   **Mitigation:** Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and implement robust security measures.
